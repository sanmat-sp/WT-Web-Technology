            <h2 id="A"><a href="#1">Introduction</a></h2>
            <p>   One of the greatest warrier India ever had, who fought for freedom and Swarajja. Some people know them as "<i>First freedom fighter of INDIA</i>".They were king of Rajput kingdom named as Mewar for nearly 25 years.</p>
       <hr/><h2 id="B"><a href="#2">Family</a></h2>
            <p>Their father, Rana Uday Singh ji, were also a great king of Mewar. Mother, Maharani Jayavanta Bai ji, were a great queen of Mewar, with the greatest personality ever. Because of their mother Maharana Pratap also had great peronality and one of the most influential personality. Today's generation needs to learn many things from their Life. Maharana ji'S wife name is Maharani Ajabde bai. They were also a great personality. In my life i mainly admire Maharana Pratap Aingh ji, Maharani Ajabde bai ji and Maharani Jayavanta bai ji</p>
       <hr/><h2 id="C"><a href="#3">Strength</a></h2>
   <dl>
            <dt>Javelin:</dt><dd>Maharan ji had the ability to throw the javelin nearly to a distance of 500m. Once they killed an enemy from a distance nearly equal to 500m.</dd></dt>
            <dt>Sword:</dt><dd>Maharana ji were a brillient sword player. And one more thing they used to keep 2 swords. Because if the enemy is unarmed Maharana ji used to give one sword to enemy to give them equal opportunity. They never used to attack an unarmed person.</dd>
            <dt><i><b>CHETAK</b></i>:</dt><dd>one of the biggest strenght of Maharana ji was Chetak. Chetak was a heavenly horse. Chetak used to understand everything what Maharana ji used to say. Chetak once saved Maharana ji's life in <i>Haldighati</i> war by running for nearly 2kms with wounded leg and jumped across a river of 26 feet and unfortunately died there only.</dd>
            <dt>Mind:</dt><dd>One of the biggest power of Maharana ji was their Mind. Even after losing whole kingdom to Mughal king Akbar, they have the mental stability to overcome the defeat. And they won 85% of their previous land which was lost to Akbar. They used to sleep on grass, used to est food made of grass and used to live in forest for many years. And once they killed a devil kind of person by punching on chest, and the heart of that person got crushed. They had the ability to control the mind and concentrate the whole power at one part of body.</dd>
